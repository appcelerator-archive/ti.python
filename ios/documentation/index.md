# python Module

## Description

An implementation of the Skulpt (http://www.skulpt.org/) project in Titanium.

In addition to gaining access to many of the core language functions, we can actually execute Python statements inline and/or interact with pre-existing Python classes stored in external files.

## Accessing the python Module

To access this module from JavaScript, you would do the following:

	var Python = require('ti.python');

The python variable is a reference to the Module object.
